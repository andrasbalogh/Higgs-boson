# Higgs boson equation in de Sitter spacetime, numerical simulations

Python CUDA code using the CuPy library, and a faster Fortran CUDA code, both with visualization. 
The computations were done on Centos and Ubuntu workstations using CUDA v. 11.4 with Nvidia Tesla K-80 GPUs. The Python code also runs on Google Colaboratory. Both codes output binary files that can be postprocessed for visualization using ParaView. The Python code can also visualize line plot over the diagonal of the three-dimensional cube which is the computational domain.
